# Arcade Shield extension for MakeCode for BBC micro:bit (V2)

This MakeCode extension allows you to use any of the  MakeCode Arcade shields with the MakeCode for BBC micro:bit editor. The extension provides access 
to the screen and buttons on the shield, and has
a Bitmap abstraction with numerous drawing primitives
(draw line, circle, square, etc).
Bitmaps also can be created using the built-in
image editor in MakeCode.

## Simulator support

The extension provides a simulator for the display,
with keyboard controls mapping to the inputs of
the display shield (A and B buttons, and the D-pad).
